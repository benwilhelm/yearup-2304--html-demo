# HTML Workshop Demo Code

This is the code that we wrote together as a group during the HTML demo workshop on Monday April 17. This code corresponds roughly to Section 1-1 of Workbook 1b. I've also made some minor changes to link destinations and such.

**Please Note** The HTML we worked with in the workshop was not fully valid, because we hadn't introduced the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags that a valid HTML document requires. I've added that boilerplate to the pages you see here. For more about the basic HTML page structure, see page 1-11 of Workbook 1b.
